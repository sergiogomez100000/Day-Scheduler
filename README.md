# Day-Scheduler
My application is a 9AM-5PM hourly work day Scheduler designed to help the user get organized with their daily routine! It will allow users to easily add an event to certain time frames and save them for the next day. Time frames will be color coded to emphasize if the event has past, is current, or for a later time.
