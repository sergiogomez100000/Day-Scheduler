# Day-Scheduler
My application is a 9AM-5PM hourly work day Scheduler designed to help the user get organized with their daily routine! It will allow users to easily add an event to certain time frames and save them for the next day. Time frames will be color coded to emphasize if the event has past, is current, or for a later time.

# Links
You can view my application here (https://sergiogomez100000.github.io/Day-Scheduler/) and my repository here(https://github.com/sergiogomez100000/Day-Scheduler).

# Usage
Anyone who wants to be more organized can use my application. It is easily accessible so anyone can add whatever they wish to any time frame presented.
